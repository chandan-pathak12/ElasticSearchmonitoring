Step #1:Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
Update the system before starting the installation.

sudo apt update 
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 1
Elasticsearch requires Java to run. Install OpenJDK 8 by running the following command.

sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 2
Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/bin
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 3
Step #2:Install Elasticsearch on Ubuntu
First update the system again.

sudo apt update
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 4
Download .deb file for elasticsearch.

wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/release/org/elasticsearch/distribution/deb/elasticsearch/2.3.1/elasticsearch-2.3.1.deb
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 5
To install the .deb file use dpkg command.

sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-2.3.1.deb
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 6
Now lets setup network configuration for that open the elasticsearch.yml file.

sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 7
By default, Elasticsearch is configured to bind to localhost. If you want to access Elasticsearch from outside the server, you need to modify its configuration.

Find the line that starts with #network.host, uncomment it, and change its value to 0.0.0.0

network.host: 0.0.0.0
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 8
enable the elasticsearch service.

sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 9
start the elasticsearch service

sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 10
you can check it’s status to see if it’s running properly or not.

sudo systemctl status elasticsearch
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 11
You can verify that Elasticsearch is running by accessing it through a web browser.

give your ubuntu instance PublicIP address:9200 port number which is default port number for elasticsearch.

How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 12
Step #3:Install Prometheus on Ubuntu
Download the latest version of Prometheus from the GitHub repository using the following command.

wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.30.0/prometheus-2.30.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 13
extract the downloaded archives.

tar xvfz prometheus-2.30.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
The command extracts the contents of the file prometheus-2.30.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 14
now navigate to the extracted directory using following command.

cd prometheus-2.30.0.linux-amd64
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 15
navigate to the /etc/systemd/system, this is where typically systemd unit files are located, which are used for managing services on Linux systems.

cd /etc/systemd/system
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 16
now lets create a service for Prometheus named prometheus.service.

sudo vi prometheus.service
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 17
add the following content into it.

[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/prometheus-2.30.0.linux-amd64/prometheus --config.file=/home/ubuntu/prometheus-2.30.0.linux-amd64/prometheus.yml
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 18
Now our prometheus.service is created.

After this reload the daemon service, enable, and start the Prometheus service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable prometheus.service
sudo systemctl start prometheus.service
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 19
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 20
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 21
now Verify the status of the Prometheus service using following command:

sudo systemctl status prometheus.service
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 22
If your service is running properly then you can run prometheus by running

Public IP:9090 which is default port for prometheus in url.

How to Monitor Redis with Prometheus and Grafana 13
Step #4:Install Grafana on Ubuntu
First import the GPG key used by the Grafana package.

wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 23
then add the Grafana repository to the APT sources.

sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 24
After adding the repository update the package lists

sudo apt update
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 25
then install the grafana.

sudo apt install grafana
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 26
Start and enable the Grafana service.

sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 27
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 28
and if everything works fine and your service is running properly then run grafana by running your Public IP:3000 which is default port of grafana in searchbar.

you will see the login page of grafana (UI) user interface

Grafana has admin as default username and password.

How to Monitor Redis with Prometheus and Grafana 19
it will ask for changing the password you can change it or skip it.

How to Monitor Redis with Prometheus and Grafana 20
then you will see the welcome page of grafana.

How to Monitor Redis with Prometheus and Grafana 21
Step #5:Install Elasticsearch Exporter for Prometheus
Create a system user for Elasticsearch.

sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false elastic_search
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 29
then download the elasticsearch exporter on our ec2 instance.

To download the different versions visit the official website of Elasticsearch exporter prometheus Github page.

sudo wget https://github.com/prometheus-community/elasticsearch_exporter/releases/download/v1.5.0/elasticsearch_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 30
extract the files.

sudo tar -xvzf elasticsearch_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 31
Now lets move to the extracted directory.

cd elasticsearch_exporter-1.5.0.linux-amd64/
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 32
Copy the exporter binary to /usr/local/bin/

sudo cp elasticsearch_exporter /usr/local/bin/
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 33
Now change the exporter binary ownership

sudo chown elastic_search:elastic_search /usr/local/bin/elasticsearch_exporter
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 34
Create a elasticsearch_exporter.service file.

sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/elasticsearch_exporter.service
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 35
add the following content into it.

[Unit]
Description=Prometheus ES_exporter
After=local-fs.target network-online.target network.target
Wants=local-fs.target network-online.target network.target

[Service]
User=elastic_search
Nice=10
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/elasticsearch_exporter --es.uri=http://elastic_search@localhost:9200 --es.all --es.indices --es.timeout 20s
ExecStop=/usr/bin/killall elasticsearch_exporter

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 36
Now reload the service and after that enable and start it.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch_exporter
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch_exporter
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 37
Check the status of the service to if the service is running properly or not.

sudo systemctl status elasticsearch_exporter.service
How to Monitor Elasticsearch with Prometheus and Grafana 38
